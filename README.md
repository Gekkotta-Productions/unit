A game and server backend developed over the course of one and a half days at YHacks. Utilizes the Bump API as a core gameplay feature. 

Inspired by the goal of creating a mobile game that physically brings people together and allows them to meet new people along the way.

Premise: Everyone starts out as an individual player and is the owner of their own team. When a player "bumps" phones with another player, they have the option of joining the other players team, or staying in their own team. You get a different amount of points for "bumping into someone" depending on whether they are someone you have already met, or a teammate.

Objective:
Collect as many points as you can each week by "Bumping" phones with other players in real life. Teams have all the players scores aggregated into one score, so we strongly suggest joining a team or making one with your friends (THAT IS THE POINT OF THE GAME ^_^). Each week holds a round, which will alot players time to obtain as many points as possible. Note however that there is a maximum bump limit and time interval in which you can bump within your team. Therefore, a bigger team has the advantage. The team with the most points at the end of the round wins.
